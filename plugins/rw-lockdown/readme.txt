Secures your site from potential exploitable security issues. Please view the RW Lockdown link to the left for more info.

== Description ==
Security of all of our clients sites is crucially important to the Richweb team. We developed this plugin to help protect you against the most common forms of Wordpress website hacking methods.

The Richweb Wordpress Lockdown Plugin is a tool, specifically designed for our Wordpress clients that helps ensure your site is not susceptible to "MySQL Injection" or "Cross-site Scripting" (also called XSS) attacks.

This plugin, along with a server side application, changes the ownership of your files from web-writeable to owned by the core system itself, which means that unless you are directly logged into the server as the root user, you will not be able to make any changes to any files within your website.

It\'s essentially a body guard, protecting your website. If you don\'t have the "secret code-word" (Unlocking your site), you won\'t be able to make any changes to your site.

If you\'re only making changes to your content or uploading pictures, videos, etc, you do not need to unlock your site.

The only time you should unlock your website is if you\'re adding or changing a theme, a plugin, or performing an update to Wordpress. Please remember to re-lock your site after you\'re done making these changes!

For more information about how we protect you with this plugin, please visit http://forums.richweb.com/index.php?topic=16 on our forums.
